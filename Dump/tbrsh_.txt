1. TB6612FNG Motor Driver (First Image)
This is a dual H-Bridge motor driver, often used to control motors in robotics projects. Key points from the schematic:

Pin Connections:

VM (Pin 1): Motor power supply (Vmax = 15V). Ensure this is connected to your battery or motor power source.
VCC (Pin 24): Logic voltage (2.7-5.5V). Connect this to the 5V supply from the Teensy 4.1 or another appropriate logic voltage source.
A01/A02 (Pins 3, 5), B01/B02 (Pins 10, 12): These go to the motors.
PWM (Pins 22, 19): Connect these to PWM-capable pins on the Teensy to control the motor speed.
AIN1, AIN2, BIN1, BIN2 (Pins 21, 23, 17, 19): These pins control the direction of the motor. Connect these to GPIO pins of the Teensy.
STBY (Pin 7): Must be connected to VCC (high) to enable the motor driver.
Power Capacitors: Make sure you place capacitors (C1, C2) across VM and VCC for stability (typically 10μF as shown).

Troubleshooting:

Check that STBY is high; otherwise, the motors will not run.
Ensure proper grounding between the Teensy and motor driver.
Verify the motor supply voltage (VM) and logic voltage (VCC) are within limits (VM = 15V max, VCC = 2.7-5.5V).
2. RLS08 IR Sensor Array (Second Image)
This IR sensor array is for line following:

Power Supply (5V): Connect to the 5V and GND pins of the Teensy.

Analog and Digital Outputs (A1-A8, D1-D8):

Analog outputs (A1-A8) give proportional values to how much IR reflection is received.
Digital outputs (D1-D8) give binary values for threshold detection (can be adjusted using the onboard potentiometers).
These should be connected to appropriate analog and digital pins on the Teensy for reading sensor values.
LED Indicators: Useful for quick checks on sensor functionality.

Troubleshooting:

Check the sensor power supply.
If analog output isn’t functioning correctly, try adjusting the sensitivity using the potentiometers.
Check each sensor’s corresponding LED for detection.
3. LM358 Operational Amplifier (Third Image)
This is a dual operational amplifier IC that can be used for signal conditioning or amplification.

Pin Connections:

Pin 4 (GND) and Pin 8 (V+): Connect to your power supply (e.g., 5V).
Input/Output Pins: The amplifier can be used to amplify sensor outputs if needed. Inputs to inverting/non-inverting pins, outputs at Pin 1 and Pin 7.
Troubleshooting:

Check that power is supplied correctly between V+ and GND.
Ensure proper feedback loops are in place for the amplification, or adjust based on the circuit design.
4. Teensy 4.1 Microcontroller (Fourth Image)
This is the main controller for the system:

Pin Mapping: Ensure all motor driver pins (PWM, DIR) and sensor outputs (analog/digital) are properly connected to corresponding pins on the Teensy. The pin map provided can help identify which pins are analog-capable (for reading sensor values) or PWM-capable (for motor control).

Power: Ensure the Teensy is powered through the 5V USB line, or you can use an external power source connected to the 5V or VIN pin.

Troubleshooting:

Double-check the pin mapping.
Ensure the code running on Teensy matches the hardware connections (i.e., the right GPIOs are used).
Check Teensy's power and ground connections.
General Troubleshooting Tips:
Power: Ensure all components share a common ground and that voltage levels are within the operating range of each component.
Connections: Use a multimeter to check for continuity and proper voltage at critical points.
Signal Checking: If you're not receiving expected signals, use an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to check the data lines.
